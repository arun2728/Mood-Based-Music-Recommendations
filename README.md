# AI Powered Mood-Based Music Recommendation System

## Introduction:
The AI-Powered Mood-Based Music Recommendation System is an innovative project developed using Python and its frameworks and libraries. It aims to provide users with personalized music recommendations based on their current mood. By leveraging AI technologies, the system analyzes the user's mood through voice input and recommends songs that align with their emotional state. The project is implemented as a web-based application, utilizing Python frameworks for both the frontend and the overall system functionality.

## Functionality:
The web application opens with an audio prompt asking the user, "How are you feeling today?" The user's response is recorded as audio input and processed using the Whisper library, which converts the audio to text. This text is then passed to an AI model trained to classify emotions. By accurately identifying the user's emotion, the system can proceed to recommend appropriate songs from the pre-categorized song collection.

## Song Organization:
The project involves creating a well-structured folder that contains songs categorized based on language (Hindi and English) and further divided into emotions (sad, angry, happy, love). Each song file is stored in the respective emotion folder, ensuring efficient retrieval and playback of songs based on the user's emotional state. The organization of songs simplifies the recommendation process.

## Song Recommendation:
Once the user's emotion is identified, the system retrieves songs from the corresponding emotion folder. Python frameworks and libraries are employed to facilitate the recommendation process. The system presents a list of recommended songs that align with the user's current mood. The user can play the recommended songs directly through the web application. Additional options, such as skipping or replaying songs, are provided to enhance the user's experience.

## Deployment:
To make the project accessible and efficient, it is deployed using Python frameworks and libraries. The web application is hosted on a free cloud-based platform that offers suitable resources, such as 2CPUs and 16GB of RAM. Python frameworks provide the necessary tools to deploy the project seamlessly, ensuring its availability without significant cost implications.

## Significance:
This project holds great significance as it combines the power of AI, natural language processing, and music to create a personalized experience for users. By accurately recognizing and understanding the user's emotions, the system provides tailored music recommendations, fostering a positive and immersive user experience. The use of Python and its frameworks allows for efficient development, deployment, and maintenance of the project. Additionally, completing this project independently showcases your proficiency in Python and highlights your dedication to developing innovative solutions.

In conclusion, the AI-Powered Mood-Based Music Recommendation System developed using Python and its frameworks offers a novel approach to music recommendation. By leveraging AI models for speech recognition and emotion classification, the system provides users with a personalized music experience. Python frameworks and libraries facilitate the implementation of the project, ensuring efficient deployment and maintenance. This project showcases your skills and dedication to utilizing Python for developing innovative solutions.
